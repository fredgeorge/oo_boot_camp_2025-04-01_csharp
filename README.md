## OO Boot Camp starting template for C# class

C# is relatively easy to use with both Visual Studio
(with or without Resharper) and with Jetbrains Rider.

Note: This implementation was setup to use:

- JetBrains Rider 2024.3.2
- .NET 9.0
- xunit 2.9.3 for testing

Open the reference code:

- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
    - Clone, or pull and extract the zip
- Open the code in your IDE
- Navigate to the reference code root, and enter

There are two projects: One for the Code, and a
separate project for the Tests. This encourages 
testing only the public things in the Code

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and necessary libraries exist).
There should be errors in RectangleTest. 
Fixing them is the first exercise!
